        ">For our project, we decided to make a model that uses a combination of pre and in-game features to predict the outcome of NFL matchups. Essentially, we are trying to determine which team will win a football game as it is unfolding, not just beforehand. The questions we are trying to answer in our analysis are which factors are the most effective at predicting the game results.By identifying which pieces of data are most influential during the game, our model can highlight trends or key performance indicators that matter the most. This insight could help players, coaches, or analysts make more informed decisions in real time and better understand how specific events impact the final result."

        "##**Dataset Overview**\n",
        "This NFL game outcome dataset contains 11,330 team-game records spanning from the 2002 to 2024 regular seasons The dataset contains 21 features organized into four main categories: identifiers (game_id, posteam, season, week), offensive statistics (5 features), defensive statistics (5 features), game context (4 features), and the target variable (outcome). After cleaning, the dataset represents 5,665 complete games with 32 unique NFL teams, maintaining a balanced structure where each game generates two records.\n",
        "\n",
        "##**Feature Characteristics and Distribution**\n",
        "The dataset exhibits good balance with exactly 50% wins and 50% losses across all records, as expected from the paired nature of game outcomes. However, a signifiant home field advantage is evident in the data: home teams win 56.35% of games (3,192 wins) compared to away teams' 43.65% (2,473 wins), representing a substantial 12.69 percentage point advantage. This home field advantage has remained relatively consistent across all 23 seasons analyzed, showing minimal variance over time, which suggests it is a stable and persistent factor in NFL outcomes.\n",
